## Hello and welcome to my GitHub page! ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! I'm Talieh and I'm so glad you're here to join in on my data journey. It all started 7 years ago in a sales department, where I got to grips with creating reports and dashboards using Excel, VBA, and QlikView. My curiosity soon led me to the world of marketing analytics, where I enjoyed digging into campaign results and brand health. This experience was a springboard into a business analyst role, where I used Power BI to make life easier for retail sales teams with better reporting tools. More recently, I've been back in the data analyst seat, this time in education, crafting systems that help managers and their teams save precious time. In the last ten months, I've been leveling up my skills in Python, SQL, and Machine Learning through Monash University's Data Analysis Bootcamp, and I'm building cool projects along the way. I'm excited about what's next and really appreciate you stopping by to share in this journey with me. Cheers to more learning and growing together!
